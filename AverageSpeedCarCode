Code a linear solution to find the average speed a car must run before finishing the line within an elapsed time.
The distance traveled would be given in meters and the time elapsed would be given in seconds.
Your output should be km/hrs.
对线性解决方案进行编码，以找出汽车在经过的时间内完成线路之前必须行驶的平均速度。

speed = int(input())


    distance, duration = [int(j) for j in input().split()]

# Write an action using print

    print(distance)
    print(duration)
    dist=distance/1000
    dur=duration/3600  

    sp=dist/dur
 
    print(sp)
